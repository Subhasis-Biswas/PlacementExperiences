HOW TO WRITE YOUR EXPERIENCE
-----------------------------------

* Navigate to `main/<company_name>/<role_name>` and create file `<your_name>.txt`. Write your experiences within the file.

If folder does not exist beforehand for your company or role, create one according to the naming convention.

--
NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS: 
1. You can use Markdown (.md) (best option), LaTeX (.tex) files as well. In case you're not comfortable with these methods, use .docx/.pdf.
2. Try to write down your experience post interview itself. If you're short on time, just put some bullet points/outline on how the interview went, instead of writing out a detailed document. You can come back and update it later.

------------------------------------
HOW TO WRITE YOUR REMARKS
------------------------------------

Create a folder in `personal_profiles_remarks`  with name `<your_name>`. Put your CVs/background information as you wish within your own folder.

Maintenance
-----------------------------------

We'll try to periodically commit on GitHub to track the changes across the entire season. Anyways, that's optional and if not done, won't impact the process in any way.

If you're willing to maintain the GitHub repo, just fork this repository and sync the latest changes of the OneDrive folder, then submit a pull request.
